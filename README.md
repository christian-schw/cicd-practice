## Introduction
This repository was created as part of IBM's "Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD)" course.<br>
It's a project about building a CI/CD pipeline.<br>
Much of the code was cloned from the IBM repository: https://github.com/ibm-developer-skills-network/wtecc-CICD_PracticeCode<br>

## What I have done as part of the project
TODO: Maybe delete two lines below.<br>
As a lot of the work was done in the terminal, it is not visible in the repository.<br>
I therefore explain my completed tasks in the project below.<br>
<br>

### Setup of GitHub Actions and creation of workflow YAML file
First implemented the setup for GitHub Actions: The creation of a .github/workflows folder with a workflow YML file.<br>
The name of the workflow as well as the events, the job and the runner including the container were defined.<br>

## Getting Started
The code was only executable with the help of the IBM Cloud IDE.<br>
The IDE had many necessary tools and accesses preconfigured. These include, for example, Kubernetes installation or IBM Cloud Container Registry.
